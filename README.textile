h1. iCal Analyzer

Reads in your computer's iCal files and outputs statistics such as average, min and max hours spent per calendar.

I found this useful because I use a dozen iCal calendars to record how I spend my time. I wanted to quickly see
whether I was putting in enough time to various projects, and how much exercise, socializing and time wasting
I was doing, too. 

I may add more features in the future. Feedback desirable: diN0bot@bilumi.org
