h1. iCal Analyzer

Reads in computer's iCal files (*.ics, Info.plist, *.calendar and *.group). Currently, this requires running this script on a Mac. Files are assumed to be in ~/Library/Calendars.

Outputs to console statistics such as average, min, max and total hours spent per calendar. Also creates a google chart image, 'chart.png'.

h2. Run

1. Checkout the files from the GitHub repository at http://github.com/diN0bot/iCal-Analyzer/tree/master

bq.  git clone git://github.com/diN0bot/iCal-Analyzer.git

2. Execute the main python script

bq. python main.py

3. Google graph creation depends on pygooglechart

bq. http://pygooglechart.slowchop.com/

h2. Motivation

I found this useful because I use a dozen iCal calendars to record how I spend my time. I wanted to quickly see whether I was putting in enough time to various projects, and how much exercise, socializing and time wasting I was doing each day.

I may add more features in the future. Feedback desirable: diN0bot@bilumi.org
