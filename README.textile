h1. iCal Analyzer

Reads in computer's iCal files (*.ics, Info.plist, *.calendar and *.group). Currently, this requires running this script on a Mac. Files are assumed to be in ~/Library/Calendars.

Outputs to console statistics such as average, min, max and total hours spent per calendar. Also creates a google chart image, 'chart.png'.

bq.  git clone git://github.com/diN0bot/iCal-Analyzer.git

2. Execute the main python script

bq. python main.py

3. Google graph creation depends on pygooglechart

bq. http://pygooglechart.slowchop.com/

h2. Status

Proof-of-concept

ToDo
 * instead of splitting events that cross midnight, redefine each TimePeriod to end with sleep rather than adhere to exact 24 hr day.
 * generalize by reading feeds from gCal and exported iCal?
 * more extensible graph with horizontal scrolling and zooming
 * handle timezones
 ** Right now I have events entered into iCal from different timezones as I traveled.  Events entered in Berlin actually changes times now that I'm back in Boston.
 * handle multi-line summaries
 ** Summaries are stored in multiple lines. Add to summary field as encounter more lines that start with double spaces before encountering next key.
 * populate groups

h2. Motivation

I found this useful because I use a dozen iCal calendars to record how I spend my time. I wanted to quickly see whether I was putting in enough time to various projects, and how much exercise, socializing and time wasting I was doing each day.

I may add more features in the future. Feedback desirable: diN0bot@bilumi.org
